# Sitting is the new smoking.

Avoid sitting: GUI app built using Tkinter, Pandas, and Matplotlib

![init window](avoid_sitting.png)

This small app tells you how many minutes you have been sitting. Displaying a warning after 35 minutes. So to remind you to stand up. 

Apparently, sitting for less than 40 minutes does not have big consequences on your health. More on this on a 2nd update.

## Release

Not available yet on any OS. I dont own a Windows PC and even if I will get to own one I will not ever install Python on it. I will probably build a GNU/Linux and MacOS version.

## Running Environment
Back in 2018 the only working PC I had was this Acer notebook I bought back in 2009, almost 10yrs and operating just fine.

Unfortunately its end came in 2021, it won't start, probably the BIOS battery run out, or something else. The HDD still works though.

- OS: Debian 9
- PC: Sony vaio J-series, previously Acer aspire one Atom Proc/RAM 2GB
- Editor: Emacs
